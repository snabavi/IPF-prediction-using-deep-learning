### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Welcome to the IPF Prediction Using Deep Learning project! Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease that irreversibly transforms lung tissue into rigid fibrotic structures, leading to debilitating symptoms such as shortness of breath and chronic fatigue. The heterogeneity and complexity of this disease, particularly regarding its severity and progression rate, have made predicting its future course a complex and challenging task. Besides, traditional diagnostic methods based on clinical evaluations and imaging have limitations in capturing the diseaseâ€™s complexity.

This repository presents a deep learning approach to predict the progression of IPF using the Kaggle Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression dataset, which includes computed tomography images and clinical information. By leveraging a proposed context-aware sequential-parallel hybrid transformer model and enriching predictions with clinical information, the method achieved a Laplace Log-Likelihood score of âˆ’6.508, outperforming previous techniques. This work highlights the potential of advanced deep learning models in providing accurate predictions, aiding in the diagnosis and management of IPF. The overview of the proposed method is shown in figure below:
